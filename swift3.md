# Migration from Swift 2.3 to 3.0

I've read several articles on migrating to Swift 3 which are all quite good, but this is my story.  I started my iOS development back in January of 2016 and right around October everything turned upside down with the release of Swift 3.  Since I was furiously trying to get features into my app so I could go live on the App Store, I had put migration in the backlog for some time with a lower priority, if it ain't broke then don't fix it.  It wasn't until I wanted to leverage some external libraries that I decided Swift 2.3 was holding me back so it was time to upgrade.  I seem to remember that you can install different Swift compiler versions and reference it by changing symlinks or something, but I didn't want to hack up my development environment so the only way was to first upgrade Xcode 7.3 to 8.  Fortunately I have multiple Macs and can install different versions of Xcode to play around with, but my first experience with Xcode 8 after you open up a workspace/project is that you get this annoying pop up dialogue asking if you want to convert your code to Swift 3, there is an option to do this _later_, but if you click this, there's a follow up popup that asks if you're sure you want to do this later and reverses the order of the _later_ and _convert_ buttons, it's almost like those free p0rn sites in the olden days where they have these almost real looking hyperlinks, but when you click on them, they end up opening 50 tabs on your browser to different places, click bait or something along those lines, seemingly dishonest, but there's no material gain for Apple I'm guessing for this.  Prompting for conversion immediately smelled of some interface incompatibility issues with Swift 2.3, on the one hand it's nice that Apple's created a tool to help with migration, but that just scares the living bejesus out of me!  Another ensuing dialogue pops up if you click _convert_ asking which frameworks to include in the conversion.  For the record, I have been using Cocoapods and rely on quite a few external libraries:  [http://github.com/alamofire/alamofire][Alamofire], Crypto, Font-Awesome-Swift, KeychainSwift, Kingfisher, SwiftyJSON, and SwiftWebSocket.  By default, all of your pods are included and checked for conversion.  I typically take the defaults if I'm new to something, it's like when you're reading Charles Dickens for the first time, say The Great Expectations, and you find yourself checking the dictionary every 10 words to the point where you're fed up and then you realize if you only skipped ahead, you'd probably get much more context from the next 20 words and could take a pretty darn good guess at what the word means, the same applies here, no need to go knee deep if it's unnecessary, there are plenty of other things to learn.  But taking the defaults ends up with a huge list of files that need conversion, including some of the external library files.  So if you go to the migration guide for Swift 3, it suggests that you either wait for the author to make their library Swift 3 compliant, or you include their sources in your project as a sub-module, hell no, not in a million years, I'm not going to maintain that code base for any amount of time, not fond of merges at all!  For all of my external library dependencies, I noticed that they had mostly migrated to Swift 3, but the fact that the migration tool was telling me that they had all this incorrect syntax in their library really caused me to be doubtful.
So that first experience caused me to give up and go back to adding features to my app instead.  But over the Christmas Holidays, I decided that it's time to bite the bullet and take care of this technical debt so that I could run full speed in 2017!  For some reason, I looked at all the github pages for my external dependencies and all the issues searching for Swift 3 and it seemed like they had support for this, so I tried again.  And again, the popup with all the frameworks checked by default showed up again and this time, probably through my trial and error senses, I decided to uncheck all the external libraries because they should be all Swift 3 compatible, I was seeing some glaring 2.3 code from the conversion diff output, it was like the source code was cached somewhere for an older version that wasn't Swift 3 compatible.  Low and behold that worked like a charm, what I was left with was the mess of code from my own source tree that needed to be converted to Swift 3 syntax.
